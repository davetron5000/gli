Feature: The GLI executable works as intended
  As a developer who wants to make a GLI-powered command-line app
  When I use the app provided by GLI
  I get a reasonably working application

  Background:
    Given I have GLI installed
      And my terminal size is "80x24"

  Scenario Outline: Getting Help for GLI
    When I run `gli <command>`
    Then the exit status should be 0
     And the output should contain:
    """
    NAME
        gli - create scaffolding for a GLI-powered application

    SYNOPSIS

  Scenario Outline: Getting help on scaffolding
    When I run `gli help <command>`
    Then the exit status should be 0
     And the output should contain:
    """
    NAME
        init - Create a new GLI-based project

    SYNOPSIS
        gli [global options] init [command options] project_name [command[ command]*]

    DESCRIPTION
        This will create a scaffold command line project that uses GLI for command
        line processing. Specifically, this will create an executable ready to go,
        as well as a lib and test directory, all inside the directory named for your
        project 

    COMMAND OPTIONS
        -e, --[no-]ext - Create an ext dir
        --[no-]force   - Overwrite/ignore existing files and directories
        --notest       - Do not create a test or features dir

      |command  |
      |init     |
      |scaffold |


  Scenario: GLI correctly identifies non-existent command
    When I run `gli foobar`
    Then the exit status should not be 0
     And the stderr should contain "error: Unknown command 'foobar'"

  Scenario: GLI correctly identifies non-existent global flag
    When I run `gli -q help`
    Then the exit status should not be 0
     And the stderr should contain "error: Unknown option -q"

  Scenario: GLI correctly identifies non-existent command flag
    When I run `gli init -q`
    Then the exit status should not be 0
     And the stderr should contain "error: Unknown option -q"

  Scenario: The _doc command doesn't blow up
    Given the file "gli.rdoc" doesn't exist
    When I run `gli _doc`
    Then a file named "gli.rdoc" should exist
