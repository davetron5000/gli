module GLI
  # A command to be run, in context of global flags and switches.  You are given an instance of this class
  # to the block you use for GLI::DSL#command.  This class mixes in GLI::DSL so all of those methods are available
  # to describe the command, in addition to the methods documented here, most importantly
  # #action.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #     command :list do |c| # <- c is an instance of GLI::Command
  #       c.desc 'use long form'
  #       c.switch :l
  #
  #       c.action do |global,options,args|
  #         # list things here
  #       end
  #
  #       c.command :tasks do |t| # <- t is an instance of GLI::Command
  #         # this is a "subcommand" of list
  #         
  #         t.action do |global,options,args|
  #           # do whatever list tasks should do
  #         end
